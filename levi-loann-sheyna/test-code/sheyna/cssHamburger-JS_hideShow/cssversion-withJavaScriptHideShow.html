      <h3>Basic Rules of Play</h3>
      <p>Some text goes here you and read it and it's
        interesting and helpful to what you are looking for.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="outOfBoundsContent">
      <h3>Out-of-Bounds</h3>
      <p>The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="lostDiscContent">
      <h3>Lost Disc</h3>
      <p>In Hertford, Hereford and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly
        ever happen.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="obstablesContent">
      <h3>Obstacles &amp; Relief</h3>
      <p>It's your father's fault that curse got placed and the
        place got cursed in the first place.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="courtesyContent">
      <h3>Courtesy</h3>
      <p>When a person's personality is personable he shouldn't
        oughta sit like a lump. It's harder than a matador coercin'
        a bull to try to get you off of your rump.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="optionalContent">
      <h3>Optional Relif &amp; Optional Re-Throw</h3>
      <p>For something romantic De Sade is to trenchant and
        Dickens too frantic. And Stendhal would ruin rhe plan
        of attack, As there isn't much blue in "The Red and
        the Black."</p>
    </section>

    <section id="excessiveContent">
      <h3>Excessive Time</h3>
      <p>De Maupassant's candour would cause her dismay.
        The Brontes are grander, but not very gay. Her taste
        is much blander I'm sorry to say. But is Hans Christian
        Andersen ever risque?</p>
    </section>

    <section id="misplayContent">
      <h3>Misplay</h3>
      <p>She wouldn't... therefore they didn't... So then it
        wasn't... not unless it... would she? She doesn't...
        God knows she needn't... therefore it's not.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mandatoriesContent">
      <h3>Mandatories</h3>
      <p>Greens Green and Nothing but green! Parsley, Peppers,
        Cabbages, and Celery. Asparagus and Watercress and
        Fiddlefern and Lettuce. He said "Alright!" But it
        wasn't quite, cause I caught him in the autumn in my
        garden one night!</p>
    </section>

    <section id="interferenceContent">
      <h3>Interference</h3>
      <p>Rudding through my rutabagga raiding my arugaluga
        ripping up the Rampion my champion my favorite!</p>
    </section>

    <section id="provisionalContent">
      <h3>Provisional Throws</h3>
      <p>So...there's no more fuss and there's no more scenes
        and my garden thrives! You should see my nectarine! But
        I'm telling you the same I tell Kings and Queens don't ever
        ever ever mess around with my greens! Especially the beans!</p>
    </section>

    <section id="applicationContent">
      <h3>Application of the Rules</h3>
      <p>What you do, that's the point: All the rest of it is
        chatter. If the thing you do is pure in intent, if it's
        meant, and it's just a little bent, does it matter?</p>

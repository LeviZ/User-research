*Last Updated: Nov. 11, 2014*

###Background:
Levi plays disc golf. He and his friends are quite devoted to the game. But they have trouble when they are out on a course playing the game they don't have easy access to the rules. When a play is called into conflict it is difficult to find the relevant rule in current similar applications. Players often carry the full rule book onto the field or have a pdf formatted version of the rule book on their phone.

###Objective/Goal:
We would like to create an app that would allow disc golfer to more easily access the rules to make calls while on the course playing. We seek to learn the areas that cause the most confusion among disc golfers and start by dealing with those questions.

###Hypothesis:
The people who play disc golf are struggling to find information they need to play the gave. We believe we can find a better way to provide it. We believe that proving playings with better information it will increase the their enjoyment of the game.

##Research questions:
* What are the areas of disc golf that cause the most confusion while playing?
* How do the players use the existing resources? Or do they not use them?
* How are these conflicts different between casual players and devotees of the game?
* Did the devotees' enjoyment of the game change after learning the rules?
* Why don't casual players play by all rules?

###Methodology:
* Qualitative data from user behavior interview/usability testing.
* Online statistics and demographics

###Personas:
* 20 to 30 year old men
* Tech savvy, own smart phones


From there we split into 3 groups:

**Devotees:**

* Play around 20+ times a year  
* Very familiar with the PDGA rules
* Probably refernences the rules often

**Casual players:**

* Play a couple times a year
* They know the PDGA rules exist but are not very familiar with them
* Does not use the official PDFA rules. Potentially intimated by the official rules due to skill level

**New to Game:**

* People who may have an interest in playing but do not know the official rules even exist
* May not have any interest in knowing the official rules


## Our proposed MVP

**Our goal is to improve on the way the PDGA rules are presented to a user in the *mobile environment***

Our initial MVP will be defined as follows:

* It will involve a restructering of the existing PDGA rules content
* It will take advantage of improved navigation
* It will be web based
* It will be designed completely "mobile-first"


**Possible Features in the future**
